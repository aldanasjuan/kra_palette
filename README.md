## KRA Palette

This plugin adds a kra palette docker, which lets you save swatches directly in the .kra file (hence the name).


## Installation

Copy the kra_palette into the resources/pykrita folder. It should end up like resources/pykrita/kra_palette. 

*Note: The resources folder is whatever folder your krita installation uses for resources. You can find it in Settings -> Manage Resources -> Open Resource Folder

Copy the kra_palette.desktop file into resources/pykrita as well. The folder and the .desktop files should be next to each other.
